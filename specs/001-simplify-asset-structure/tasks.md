# Tasks: Simplify Asset Directory Structure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-simplify-asset-structure/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included per TDD approach - this feature creates comprehensive test coverage for a codebase that currently has no tests.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Ruby gem**: `lib/ro/`, `test/` at repository root
- Test fixtures in `test/fixtures/`
- Public examples in `public/ro/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization, test infrastructure, and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create test directory structure: test/unit/, test/integration/, test/fixtures/
- [X] T002 [P] Create test fixtures directory with subdirectories: test/fixtures/old_structure/ and test/fixtures/new_structure/
- [X] T003 [P] Create test helper file test/test_helper.rb with common setup and assertions
- [X] T004 [P] Update Rakefile to enable test tasks (verify test/**/*_test.rb pattern works)
- [X] T005 [P] Create .gitignore entries for test artifacts: test/tmp/, *.log, .backup.*

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Test fixtures and baseline tests that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T006 [P] Create old structure test fixture in test/fixtures/old_structure/posts/sample-post/ with attributes.yml, body.md, and assets/image.jpg
- [X] T007 [P] Create new structure test fixture in test/fixtures/new_structure/posts/ with sample-post.yml and sample-post/body.md
- [X] T008 [P] Create test fixture with metadata-only node (no asset directory) in test/fixtures/new_structure/posts/metadata-only.yml
- [X] T009 [P] Create test fixture with nested assets in test/fixtures/new_structure/posts/nested-test/ with subdirectory/image.png
- [X] T010 [P] Create test fixture with multiple metadata formats: test/fixtures/new_structure/mixed/test.yml, test.json

**Checkpoint**: ‚úì Test fixtures ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Read Asset Data (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable reading assets from the new simplified structure (identifier.yml + identifier/ directory)

**Independent Test**: Create an asset with new structure and verify metadata loads from identifier.yml and assets load from identifier/ directory

---

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Migrate Existing Assets (Priority: P3)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Read) ‚Üí Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US2 (Write) ‚Üí Can start immediately after Foundational, but logically should follow US1
  - US3 (Migrate) ‚Üí Can start immediately after Foundational, but logically should follow US1+US2 since it needs to verify both reading and writing work
- **Integration (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories (US1, US2, US3)
- **Examples & Docs (Phase 7)**: Depends on US3 (migration tool) being complete
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all previous phases

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Logically depends on US1 (need to read before write), but could be developed in parallel
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Logically depends on US1+US2 (needs to verify both work), but could be developed in parallel

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Tests can run in parallel (all marked [P])
- Implementation tasks run sequentially (Collection ‚Üí Node ‚Üí Asset) due to dependencies
- Each story must be complete and independently testable before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup tasks**: T002, T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel
- **Foundational fixtures**: T006-T010 can all run in parallel
- **US1 tests**: T011-T017, T019 can run in parallel (T018 may depend on others)
- **US2 tests**: T032-T036 can all run in parallel
- **US3 tests**: T042-T050, T052, T053 can run in parallel
- **Integration tests**: T066, T067, T069, T070 can run in parallel
- **Documentation**: T078-T084 can run in parallel
- **Polish**: T082-T084, T087, T088 can run in parallel

### Sequential Requirements

- T020-T030 (US1 implementation) must run in order due to class dependencies
- T037-T040 (US2 implementation) must run in order
- T054-T065 (US3 implementation) must run in order
- T073-T077 (example migration) must run in order (backup before migrate)

```

```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T010) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T011-T031)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run all US1 tests, verify assets load from new structure
5. This gives you a working MVP that can read assets in the new simplified format

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Test infrastructure ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Read) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí MVP working! Can read new structure
3. Add User Story 2 (Write) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Can create/update assets in new structure
4. Add User Story 3 (Migrate) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Can migrate old data to new structure
5. Complete Integration, Examples, Polish ‚Üí Production ready for v5.0.0 release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup (Phase 1) + Foundational (Phase 2) together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Read) - T011-T031
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Write) - T032-T041 (may need to wait for some US1 completion)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Migrate) - T042-T065
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team collaborates on Integration (Phase 6) and Polish (Phases 7-8)

### TDD Workflow (Required for this feature)

This feature follows strict TDD due to zero existing test coverage:

1. **Red**: Write tests first (T011-T019 for US1)
2. **Verify Red**: Run tests, ensure they FAIL (proves tests are testing something)
3. **Green**: Implement code (T020-T030 for US1)
4. **Verify Green**: Run tests, ensure they PASS
5. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
6. **Repeat** for each user story

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **CRITICAL**: This is a breaking change (v4.x ‚Üí v5.0.0) - all existing ro users must migrate their data
- **Performance target**: <100ms asset lookup for 10,000 assets (SC-001)
- **Migration requirement**: Zero data loss (SC-002)
- Backward compatibility: Old structure should still work during transition period (FR-011)

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 90
- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 5 tasks
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 5 tasks
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: 21 tasks (9 tests + 12 implementation)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: 10 tasks (5 tests + 5 implementation)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: 24 tasks (12 tests + 12 implementation)
- **Integration (Phase 6)**: 7 tasks
- **Examples & Docs (Phase 7)**: 9 tasks
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: 9 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 40+ tasks can run in parallel (marked with [P])

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 only (31 tasks) delivers working read capability with new structure

**Full Feature**: All 90 tasks delivers complete v5.0.0 with read, write, migrate, tests, examples, and documentation
