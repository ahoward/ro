# Specification Quality Checklist: Hierarchical Configuration System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS

✓ Spec focuses on WHAT users need and WHY (configuration control, structure preferences)
✓ No tech stack details (mentions Map gem and YAML in Dependencies/Assumptions sections only, which is appropriate)
✓ User stories describe business value ("control fundamental behavior", "migrate collections independently")
✓ All mandatory sections complete (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

### Requirement Completeness - PASS

✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec
✓ All 15 functional requirements are testable:
  - FR-001 through FR-015 each specify concrete capabilities
  - Examples: "support `.ro.yml` files at root/collection/node" (testable by file discovery)
  - "structure config with values new/old/dual" (testable by behavior verification)

✓ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
  - SC-001: "switch structure by setting one config value" (user action metric)
  - SC-003: "discovered within 10ms per level" (performance metric)
  - SC-007: "90%+ report intuitive" (user satisfaction metric)

✓ All user stories have complete acceptance scenarios (5 scenarios per story on average)
✓ Edge cases comprehensively identified (8 edge cases documented with answers)
✓ Scope clearly bounded (In/Out of Scope sections explicit)
✓ Dependencies and assumptions documented

### Feature Readiness - PASS

✓ 15 functional requirements map to 4 prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria
✓ User scenarios cover all primary flows (P1: root config, P2: collection override, P3: node override, P4: Ruby DSL)
✓ Measurable outcomes align with feature goals (SC-001 through SC-007)
✓ Implementation details appropriately relegated to Assumptions section (e.g., "uses instance_eval")

## Notes

**Specification is COMPLETE and READY for planning phase.**

All checklist items pass. The spec is:
- Business-focused without implementation details
- Comprehensive with 4 independently testable user stories
- Well-scoped with clear boundaries
- Measurable with 7 success criteria
- Complete with no clarifications needed

Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (though clarify not needed).
