creating things out of virtual nothingness remains my favorite artform, even after 20 years as a professional software architect. right after [traversing natural landscapes and petting dogs](https://photos.app.goo.gl/FwwxEygH55JnQR8n8).

in my career i have designed custom databases and [super-compute clusters](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7922) to enable large scale meteorological verification studies before the cloud existed. designed algorithms to detect the edge of cities based on nighttime light signals combining the leading edge of computer vision techniques with geophysical data. built fast static website site generators aimed at security and scale when php was the only game in town. contributed to many open source projects, such the then nascent ruby on rails. and released over 100 of my own, some downloaded millions of times.

in my over ten years running the impact start-up focused software agency [dojo4](https://dojo4.com), working across hundreds of projects, and mentoring dozens of budding tech stars companies full of bright eyed entrepreneurs, i have been fortunate enough to see the light and dark parts of many software based journeys. it has been an eye opening education learning first hand just how much pain tiny and seemingly unimportant technical decisions can cause for future you, how focusing and refocusing on the three most important things over and over is the key to building great software that actually helps people, and witnessing how ruthless commitment to mission and vision can change the world one byte at a time.

in software as in mountaineering, although i appreciate an expedition style, i prefer, and have seen much greater success, with a fast and light approach. one that focuses on steel threads, ideals, atoms, ethics, and systems instead of just letting the market define what engineering tasks should be on the board. approaches that require personal dedication, sacrifice, and real work to execute on.

i am currently in a unique position, having reduced my own life footprint dramatically in order to create space for creativity. its because so many big problems still exist, and i would love to talk about yours, and how hard we can go, in order to solve it.  big problems, are big fun.
