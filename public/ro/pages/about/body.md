this is the part i hate.  writing about myself.

i'll start at the beginning:

* grew up in [alaska](https://photos.app.goo.gl/3aa3Fkwe9EyQg7kf6), 4th * generational irish people, been _here and there_ the past few years.
* roamed the planet racing bikes and skis.  this before phones, gps, or * digital cameras.
* raised a family in boulder, colorado.
* researched [life on earth from space](https://independent.academia.edu/arahoward) for about a decade.
* wrote a [ton of software](https://github.com/ahoward), some that [i am even proud of](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7922).
* founded, built, and ran [dojo4](/dojo4) for almost exactly a decade.
* ranted about the dangerous of big tech, and responbility of software developers, in [kyiv 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKNENzPpSrA).
* mentored dozens of techstars startups, worked with and for over a hundred.
* 2020 // COVID // massive life changes.  collapse.  like everyone else.
* subsequently, a ton of * [mountains](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZLLWKpux5jns3JUH9).
* somehow managed to get lost in the [southwest for the 42'nd time in my life](https://photos.app.goo.gl/rnSLBr9MoWMHv1zx6).
* started [riding my bike to * alaska](https://photos.app.goo.gl/wMDwwuFamRWWgZiu6).
* met a girl in [LA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/MpSigk5BJwqeouiUA).
* [almost died in an ice cave](/io/almost-died-in-an-ice-cave).
* been cranking on a [new stuff](/now).
* and [riding bikes with a broken leg](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ikwjrYWBXEvFbwbx7).
