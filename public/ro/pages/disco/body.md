as i’ve hinted on some of my socials, i’ve been working, since mid-2024, at
[synthetic echo](https://syntheticecho.com/) on a system i’ve named
**`disco`**.

`disco`

stands for _discovery_.

and it brings a unique, _critical_, and beneficial aspect to _many_ AI applications:

> **the social voice**

below are three examples of running some questions by `disco`.

in each case, the answers you'll see were informed by bringing millions of
*real conversations* had by *real humans* to bear on the question at hand.

this is in stark contrast to 'normal' AI, which instead presents the user with
an amortized, book reportish, standard, and non-controversial answer to your
query.

and that, my dear reader, with the personality of a toaster oven.

`disco` isn't about being being _objectively correct_, it's not trying to
_tell you what to think_.

instead.  it uses the power of AI to tell you _what people think_.

this way, you can make an informed decision for yourself, after examinging the
multitude of opinions out there.

`disco`'s goal is to be _subjectively correct_: to accurately reflect the
voices of people.

this is in stark contract to commerical AI, which aims to give you the most
vanilla answer, with a bias towards those that motivate you to purchase, or,
at minimum, to stay on the platforms of thier affiliate companies.

`disco` pulls no punches.

because most questions have a _variety_ of correct answers, _depending on who
you ask_.  `disco` shows you this variety, and it reveals _who_ would have
been likely to provide that type of answer, with _references_ to the source
material it used to form that conclusion.

in this way, you can just _read it and weep_ ;-)

technically, and as astute readers will have no doubt noticied, it is through
these citations that `disco` provides _verficiation of non-hallucination_.

without further ado, here are those examples.

please take some time to review the output, which provides the answers of *42
discrete audiences*.

pay careful attention not only to the citations provided which, as you shall
see, provide support for the answers given.

> 2. [What is your biggest concern about the environment?](https://gist.github.com/ahoward/6ac03564a43f6b49428659b93da74de3)
> 3. [What is your feeling towards the fortune 500?](https://gist.github.com/ahoward/59b525a24807ba2caf4f921471015ffb)


as you've hopefully realized, after reviewing the above, `disco` is not your
mother's AI.

it's a lot more honest, a lot more realitic, and it's grounded in real human
conversation.

disco has many applications.  essentially, _any_ AI application that could,
would, or should benefit from consideration of the _social voice_.

this includes, but is not limited to:

* running dynamic, real-time, surveys across audiences before making business decisions.
* having specific audiences review proposals or generated content and give honest feedback, in their own words.
* mocking national elections.
* understanding unfiltered thoughts about your company, practice, or brand, including dangerous or otherwise censored information (we have 4chan...)
* _actually_ understanding the nuances of the social conversation, instead of counting clicks, keywords, and search terms.
* and much, much more.

the above was a simple demonstration.  the technology can be brought to
bear on any problem a general purpose AI can be.  which is to say, almost all
of them.

as present, i am working hard to:

* add substack content to `disco`
* add bluesky content to `disco`
* release an API that developers can use to integrate `disco`s RAG context in thier own AI applications
* release a basic UI for non-technical people to leverage `disco`
* produce a threat index of the fortune 500 using 4chan, and other 'gray' sources
* raising a round

[reach out](/contact) if you wanna stay in touch regarding the project.

ps. for the curious, [here’s the audience configuration used in these examples.](https://gist.github.com/ahoward/95093a816c9a3f752f9d8ec421f24be5)

pss. yes, i support custom audiences of arbitrary data sources and authors.  segments #ftw
