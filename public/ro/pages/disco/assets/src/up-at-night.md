### COMPLETION
> *Exhausted sigh* Oh man, where do I even start? I'm a mom of an 11-week-old,
> and honestly, EVERYTHING keeps me up at night. Even when my baby actually
> sleeps, I lie there anticipating the next wake-up. It's like they have this
> built-in radar - the second my head hits the pillow or I get warm under the
> covers, boom! They're awake and fussing.
> 
> And don't get me started on my husband's breathing and rolling around in bed.
> Like, can you just exist quieter, please? I'm already on edge!
> 
> The worst part is seeing all these perfect moms on TikTok with their babies who
> supposedly sleep through the night at 8 weeks. Meanwhile, I'm over here in
> survival mode, up every hour, especially now that my little one has their first
> cold. It's totally normal for babies to wake up multiple times a night, but
> somehow that doesn't make it any easier.
> 
> You know what really gets me? That "active sleep" thing - nobody warned me they
> could look FULLY awake with their eyes open and still be sleeping! And the
> grunting... oh, the grunting. I swear sometimes I just stand at the edge of my
> bed staring into the void because I know what's coming the moment I try to rest.
> 
> Right now, I'm basically fantasizing about being alone in a cold hotel room
> with blackout curtains where I could just sleep uninterrupted for however long
> I want. But that's just a dream... literally, because I'm not getting any
> actual dreams these days!

> 
> And don't get me started on how these AAA developers have gotten complacent.
> They know their fanbase will eat up whatever they serve, so why bother making
> something truly groundbreaking anymore? It's all about that steady profit now.
> The passion is gone.
> 
> The communities aren't helping either. Every time I get excited about a new

> 
> I miss when gaming was simpler, when we could just enjoy things without all
> this... baggage. But here I am, lying awake, wondering what cursed creation AI
> graphics will bring next or what beloved franchise will get turned into a
> soulless grind-fest.
> 
> *Takes a long pause*
> 
> Maybe I should just stick to single-player games and stay off the subreddits.
> At least then I might get some sleep.

### COMPLETION
> *Sigh* Where do I even begin? Honestly, everything feels like it's getting
> worse lately. I'm exhausted but can't sleep because there's this constant
> weight of anxiety about what's coming next. The political climate is absolutely
> terrifying - we're seeing anti-trans sentiment everywhere, pride merchandise
> being pulled from stores, and hateful laws being passed left and right.
> 
> I see these bigots getting more and more emboldened every day. They're not even
> trying to hide it anymore - they're openly threatening people like us, and
> what's worse is that it's working! The lack of real resistance from allies is
> deafening. Sometimes I scroll through social media late at night and see these
> horrible anti-LGBTQ+ posts reaching the front page with thousands of upvotes,
> and the few people standing up for us getting downvoted into oblivion.
> 
> And now with Trump winning... God, I've been putting together a bug-out bag
> just in case. Maybe that sounds paranoid, but when you see society actively
> trying to erase your existence, you can't help but prepare for the worst. I
> keep thinking about whether I'll need to move to a blue state or even leave the
> country entirely.
> 
> You know what really gets me? When people say we should just "agree to
> disagree" about our basic human rights, or that we should "all get along
> despite politics." Like, my existence isn't up for debate! I'm not just some
> "lifestyle choice" you can disagree with!
> 
> Sometimes I find myself lying awake wondering if any of us are truly safe
> anymore. And yeah, according to that study they did, people like us are twice
> as likely to have sleep problems. No wonder - society's actively trying to kill
> us in some cases. How are we supposed to sleep through that?
