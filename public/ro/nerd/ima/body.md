`ima` is the universal unix filter.

it is one part code generator, one part writing assistant, one part magic cli.

and one part super uber ultra tiny:  currently weighing in at about 250 lines of code
while offering 80% of the functionality of insanely large, expensive, and
privacy violating ide plugins.

it is under active development and requires no dependencies except ruby and a
groq api key.  if you don't understand the difference between 'inference' and
'training' best move along... nothing to see.  keep shipping your .env files
to microsoft and openai.  no really ;-)

super short sneak peaks for now:

1. [code and prose editing with shortcodes](https://photos.app.goo.gl/lgbtthvrywtubvgr9)
2. [the do *anything* unix filter mode](https://photos.app.goo.gl/d3hopktecraq4cxls8)
3. [using local context](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ldd1tyaj5zsde1qo59)

you may have noticed but.. to date, **259 lines of code**

it will get bigger but, not by much [reach out](/contact) to learn more.
