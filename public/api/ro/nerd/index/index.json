makes me happy:</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/nerd/index/assets/terminal.jpg' alt=\"\" title=\"image of terminal\" /></p>\n\n<p>as you can read on my <a href=\"/about\">about</a> page, i have written <a href=\"/rubygems\">way too much software</a>.</p>\n\n<p>i got my start researching <em>in</em> <a href=\"https://www.boulder.noaa.gov/\">NOAA</a></p>\n\n<p><em>for</em> <a href=\"https://cires.colorado.edu/\">C.I.R.E.S</a></p>\n\n<p>while studying <em>at</em> <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/\">CU‚Äôs College of Engineering &amp; Applied Science</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>wut?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>basically, the university has a program that donates young scientists to other\nresearch institutes, to help do science.</p>\n\n<p>its goal is getting the university‚Äôs name on papers which, if you know\nanything about science, is gold.  publish or perish‚Ä¶ etc.  publishing ==\nfunding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>30</strong> years later, i realize that this was a fantastic introduction to start-up\nculture.  no b.s., just, make shit that works, and <em>go</em>.  no one to tell you\nwhat <em>‚Äònot to do‚Äô</em> or market signals that design your product for you so you\ndon‚Äôt have to actually think and be bold - just raw <em>instinct</em> about what\nshould be studied, how, and <em>why</em>.</p>\n\n<p>that, and fundraising‚Ä¶ nothing like buildig stuff and figuring out how to\npay for it at the same time  ;-)</p>\n\n<p>the first project i did at CIRES, is still one of my favorite projects of all\ntime: we wrote a system, designed to run on old-skool linux field computers,\nthat forest fire fighters would use, tactically, in the field, to decide\nweather/whether or not (pun intended), sending a crew up a canyon to battle\nthe blaze would result in them dying.  mainly it was a wind analysis tool,\nhyper local weather, delivered to a device, long before iphones became a\nthing.</p>\n\n<p>(this is my explanation for why, when the <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Kjipk8eKT88CtSRSA\">los angeles fires</a>\n erupted i hopped right on my bike and went to check them out‚Ä¶ fires and the jobs responders\nare required to do, for $26/hr, astounds me)</p>\n\n<p>subsequently, i went to work at FSL (Forecast Systems Lab) doing\nhyper-high-availability (5 9s ((99.999 % uptime))) for operational satellite\ningest systems.</p>\n\n<p>we designed cutting edge systems. and novel‚Ä¶ brutal‚Ä¶ methods of ensuring\nconsistency of classified data such as STONITH, which stands for ‚ÄúStone The\nOther In The Head‚Äù, a method used in what were then cutting edge\nhigh-availibilty clusters that would manage taking over as ‚Äòmaster‚Äô (a term\nsince banished from software, probably for the best‚Ä¶) by literally toggling\nthe power of the other node, to be damn sure it was off.  things we simpler\nthen, but also very complex.  there was a lot to invent on every project.\nsass wasn‚Äôt even a word.</p>\n\n<p>i also did a lot of work in model verification: geophysical models take\nhundreds, or thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of configurations to\nrun.  people talk about how neat 12-factor configuration is now, and i just\nshake my head‚Ä¶ what if you had to manage millions of configuration values?\nthe next trick is version them, so we know how they change over time because,\nas scientists, if we make a change to say, a cloud physics model, we need to\n‚Äòtest it‚Äô.  but</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>how <em>do</em> you test software, when you don‚Äôt now the ‚Äòright answer‚Äô?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the approach is actually, theoretically, simple:</p>\n\n<p>you hold all variables, all the hundreds of thousands of them, constant, make\nchanges to a few, and then look for patterns of changes in the output.  in the\ncase of weather models, this could be mean that a change to a cloud physics\nmodel resulted in predicting 8/9 historical storms with accuracy, vs. the 7/9\na previous iteration would have predicted.</p>\n\n<p>this type of analysis, foreign to many engineers, is back with vengance,</p>\n\n<p>thanks to <a href=\"/disco\">AI</a>‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>my next stint was at <a href=\"https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/\">The National Geophysical Data Center</a>, where i was able to participate in a bunch of super cool research:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/purls/can-poverty-rates-be-estimated-using-satellite-data\">/purls/can-poverty-rates-be-estimated-using-satellite-data</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/purls/a-global-inventory-of-coral-reef-stressors-based-on-satellite-observed-nighttime-lights\">/purls/a-global-inventory-of-coral-reef-stressors-based-on-satellite-observed-nighttime-lights</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/purls/change-detection-in-satellite-observed-nighttime-lights-1992-2003\">/purls/change-detection-in-satellite-observed-nighttime-lights-1992-2003</a></li>\n  <li><a

 <li><a href=\"/purls/global-distribution-and-density-of-constructed-impervious-surfaces\">/purls/global-distribution-and-density-of-constructed-impervious-surfaces</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and built very, very <a href=\"https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7922\">large super-compute</a>,\nessentially big fat map-reduce style computing but, at the time, neither of\nthose terms existed.  we had to invent novel ways, of moving our code of off\nbig-endian (not spelled wrong) cray (also not spelled wrong) machines and onto\ntons of commodity hardware.  namely, hundreds of linux boxen.</p>\n\n<p>i also did a ton of work around clustering‚Ä¶ very low level c/c++ code, using\nideas from signal processing and computer vision, to detect the edges of cities\nvia a process similar to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)\">watershed algorithm</a>\n but‚Ä¶  at scale.</p>\n\n<p>throughout my tenure at NGDC, i was allowed to release piles of open source\nsoftware and, i am very, very grateful for this.  eventually i was able to\nshare, through oss, over 200 open source projects enjoyed by many.  i think\nthis was foundational to my eventually winning a ‚Äòruby hero‚Äô award and wish\nthat more young engineers had creative time to just build things.   this, is\nwhere true innovation comes from i believe.  not board rooms or from mining\nthe data to just give people what they want.  which, is probably potato chips.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>coffee break‚Ä¶</strong></p>\n<hr />\n\n<p>next, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-greenstreet-082635/\">this cowboy</a>\nhired me: to compile the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/\">GNU scientific library</a> on.. wait for it‚Ä¶  <strong>windows</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>yep, i am <em>that</em> old!</p>\n\n<p>(strange that, for the first time ever, i would actually now consider owning a\nmicro$oft computer but‚Ä¶ only because they run linux ;-)</p>\n\n<p>anyhow, Greg worked for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dospringer/\">Don Springer</a>, at company called <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-collective-intellect-060512.html\">Collective Intellect</a>.  which, at the time, was the ‚ÄúMobius Group‚Äù (which would eventually become <a href=\"https://foundry.vc/\">The Foundry Group</a> and‚Ä¶ <strong>#BOOM</strong> .. start-ups in Boulder, Colorado, were a thing.</p>\n\n<p>it was fun time.</p>\n\n<p>it was after this that i started <a href=\"/dojo4\">dojo4</a>, which was the crown jewl in my life as a geek, for many reasons i hope to write about soon.  including close to ten years mentoring <a href=\"https://www.techstars.com/\">techstars</a> companies where, i have made some super duper great friends.</p>\n\n<p>until then, i will say, as i always do that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>this is all, always, a work in progress.</li>\n  <li>i am doing it live.</li>\n  <li>i cannot spell, so sue me.  (a little dislexic, in fact.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n",
